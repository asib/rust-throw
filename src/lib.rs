//! Throw!
//! ------
//!
//! Throw is a new experimental rust error handling library, meant to assist and build on existing
//! error handling systems.
//!
//! Throw exports two structs, `throw::ErrorPoint` and `throw::Error`. `throw::Error` stores a
//! single `original_error` variable which it is created from, and then a list of `ErrorPoint`s
//! which starts out with the original point of creation with `throw!()`, and is added to every
//! time you propagate the error upwards with `up!()`.
//!
//! *Throw does not replace existing error handling systems*. The `throw::Error` type has a type
//! parameter `E` which represents an internal error type stored. `throw::Error` just wraps your
//! error type and stores ErrorPoints alongside it.
//!
//! Throw helps you better keep track of your errors. Instead of seeing a generic "No such file or
//! directory" message, you get a stack trace of functions which propagated the error as well.
//!
//! Instead of:
//!
//! ```text
//! IO Error: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known
//! ```
//!
//! Get:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: IO Error: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known
//!     at 79:17 in zaldinar::startup (src/startup.rs)

//! ```
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Using throw!
//! ---
//!
//! The main way you use throw is through two macros, `throw!()` and `up!()`. `throw!()` is used
//! when you have a regular (non-throw) result coming from some library function that you want to
//! propagate upwards in case of an error. `up!()` is used when you have an error which was
//! created using `throw!()` in a sub-function which you want to add an error point to and
//! propagate upwards.
//!
//! Here's an example of throw in action:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate throw;
//!
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn read_log() -> Result<String, throw::Error<io::Error>> {
//!     let mut file = throw!(File::open("some_file.log"));
//!     let mut buf = String::new();
//!     throw!(file.read_to_string(&mut buf));
//!     Ok((buf))
//! }
//!
//! fn do_things() -> Result<(), throw::Error<io::Error>> {
//!     let log_contents = up!(read_log());
//!     println!("Log contents: {}", log_contents);
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let result = do_things();
//!     if let Err(e) = result {
//! #       /*
//!         panic!("{}", e);
//! #       */
//! #       assert_eq!(format!("{}", e), "Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)\
//! #       \n\tat 16:23 in rust_out (<anon>)\
//! #       \n\tat 9:19 in rust_out (<anon>)");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This simple program behaves exactly as if `Result<_, io::Error>` directly when it functions
//! correctly. When the program encounters is when throw really shines.  This will result in an
//! error message:
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)
//!    at 16:23 in main (src/main.rs)
//!    at 9:19 in main (src/main.rs)
//! ```
//!
//! These stack traces are stored inside throw::Error, and are recorded automatically when
//! `throw!()` or `up!()` returns an Err value.
//!
//! In each `at` line, the `16:23` represents `line_num:column_num`, the `main` represents the
//! module path (for example `my_program::sub_module`), and `src/main.rs` represents the path of
//! the file in which `throw!()` was used in.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Throwing directly from a function is also supported, using `throw_new!()`:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use]
//! # extern crate throw;
//! fn possibly_fails() -> Result<(), throw::Error<&'static str>> {
//!     if true {
//!         // throw_new!() will always return directly
//!         throw_new!("oops");
//!     }
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//! #   /*
//!     possibly_fails().unwrap()
//! #   */
//! #   assert_eq!(format!("{}", possibly_fails().unwrap_err()), "Error: oops\
//! #   \n\tat 6:8 in rust_out (<anon>)")
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```text
//! called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error: "oops"
//!    at 6:8 in main (src/main.rs)
//! ```
//!
//! `throw_new!()` differs from `throw!()` in that it takes a parameter directly to pass to a
//! `throw::Error`, rather than a `Result<>` to match on. `throw_new!()` will always return
//! directly from the function.
